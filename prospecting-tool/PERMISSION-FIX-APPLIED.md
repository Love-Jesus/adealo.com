# Permission Fix Applied

## What Was Fixed

We identified and fixed the following issues:

1. **User ID Mismatch**: 
   - Your Firebase Authentication user ID: `pW91rLLc3MUVfuDtM8moZocGZHi2`
   - Previous Firestore user document ID: `vIHEpwRWIVOP3WIB2gCT`
   - This mismatch was causing permission errors because the security rules check permissions based on the authenticated user ID

2. **Missing User Document**:
   - Created a new user document with your correct ID: `pW91rLLc3MUVfuDtM8moZocGZHi2`
   - Set your role to 'admin'
   - This ensures the security rules correctly identify you as an admin

3. **Missing Team Membership**:
   - Created a team member entry linking your user to the default team
   - This allows you to access team-based widgets

4. **Missing User Credits**:
   - Created user credits for your account with generous allocations
   - This ensures you can create and use widgets

## Next Steps

To complete the fix:

1. **Refresh Your Authentication**:
   - Sign out and sign back in to refresh your authentication token
   - This ensures your browser has the latest permissions

2. **Clear Browser Cache** (if needed):
   - Clear your browser cache to ensure all old data is refreshed
   - In Chrome: Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data

3. **Test Widget Access**:
   - Navigate to the Widgets page
   - You should now see real widgets from Firestore instead of mock data
   - If you still see mock data, check the browser console for errors

4. **Create a Test Widget**:
   - Try creating a new widget to verify write permissions
   - This confirms that both read and write permissions are working

## If Issues Persist

If you still encounter permission issues after following these steps:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Run `./check-user.sh` to verify your user setup
3. Ensure your domain is in the authorized domains list in Firebase Authentication settings

The hybrid solution (falling back to mock widgets) will continue to work while you troubleshoot, so you can keep using the application regardless.
