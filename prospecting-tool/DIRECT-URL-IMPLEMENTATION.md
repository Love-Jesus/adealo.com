# Direct URL Implementation for Intercom-Style Widget

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of direct URLs for the Intercom-style widget, eliminating the need for the redirect function.

## Changes Made

1. Updated HTML files to use direct Firebase Hosting URLs:
   - Changed `widget-test.html` to use `https://adealo-ce238.web.app/widget.js` instead of the relative path
   - Verified that `intercom-style-test.html` and `intercom-style-production-test.html` already use direct URLs

2. Created scripts to remove the redirect function:
   - `delete-widget-functions.sh`: Deletes the `intercomStyleWidgetAdapter` function
   - `deploy-functions-without-redirect.sh`: Deploys functions without the redirect

## Benefits of Direct URLs

1. **Improved Performance**: Eliminates an extra HTTP redirect, reducing latency
2. **Simplified Architecture**: Removes unnecessary Cloud Function, reducing complexity
3. **Cost Savings**: Fewer function invocations means lower costs
4. **Reliability**: Removes a potential point of failure in the system

## Implementation Steps

To implement the direct URL approach:

1. Update all HTML files to use the direct Firebase Hosting URL:
   ```html
   <script src="https://adealo-ce238.web.app/widget.js"></script>
   ```
   or for the Intercom-style widget:
   ```html
   <script src="https://adealo-ce238.web.app/intercom-style-widget.js" data-widget-id="YOUR_WIDGET_ID"></script>
   ```

2. Delete the redirect function:
   ```bash
   ./delete-widget-functions.sh
   ```

3. Deploy the functions without the redirect:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-functions-without-redirect.sh
   ```

## Testing

After implementation, test the widget using:

1. Local testing:
   ```bash
   cd prospecting-tool
   firebase serve --only hosting
   ```

2. Production testing:
   - Open `widget-test.html` in a browser
   - Verify that the widget loads correctly
   - Test all widget functionality (chat, book demo, call me)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can revert to the redirect approach by:

1. Restoring the redirect function in `functions/src/widget-adapter-redirect.ts`
2. Updating HTML files to use the redirect URL
3. Redeploying the functions with the redirect

## Conclusion

The direct URL implementation provides a more efficient and reliable way to load the widget script. By eliminating the redirect function, we've simplified the architecture and improved performance.
