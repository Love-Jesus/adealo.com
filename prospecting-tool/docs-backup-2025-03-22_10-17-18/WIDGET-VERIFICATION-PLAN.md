### 3. Client-Side Configuration

- **Test Case 3.1**: Configuration Application
  - **Description**: Verify that client-side configuration is properly applied
  - **Steps**:
    1. Create a test page with custom configuration
    2. Open the page in a browser
    3. Verify that the widget reflects the custom configuration
  - **Expected Result**: Widget appearance and behavior match the custom configuration

- **Test Case 3.2**: Configuration Validation
  - **Description**: Verify that invalid configuration is handled gracefully
  - **Steps**:
    1. Create a test page with invalid configuration
    2. Open the page in a browser
  - **Expected Result**: Widget handles invalid configuration gracefully with appropriate error messages

## Week 2: Server-Side Configuration

### 1. Configuration Retrieval Endpoints

- **Test Case 4.1**: Get Widget Configuration
  - **Description**: Verify that the widget configuration can be retrieved from the server
  - **Steps**:
    1. Use the test page to fetch a widget configuration
    2. Verify that the configuration is returned correctly
  - **Expected Result**: Widget configuration is retrieved successfully

- **Test Case 4.2**: Invalid Widget ID
  - **Description**: Verify that an appropriate error is returned for an invalid widget ID
  - **Steps**:
    1. Use the test page to fetch a configuration with an invalid widget ID
  - **Expected Result**: Appropriate error message is returned

### 2. Caching System

- **Test Case 5.1**: Cache Hit
  - **Description**: Verify that the caching system works for repeated requests
  - **Steps**:
    1. Use the test page to fetch a widget configuration
    2. Fetch the same configuration again
  - **Expected Result**: Second request is faster due to caching

- **Test Case 5.2**: Cache Expiration
  - **Description**: Verify that the cache expires after the TTL
  - **Steps**:
    1. Use the test page to fetch a widget configuration
    2. Wait for the cache to expire
    3. Fetch the same configuration again
  - **Expected Result**: Configuration is fetched from the server after cache expiration

### 3. Widget Interaction Tracking

- **Test Case 6.1**: Track Widget Interaction
  - **Description**: Verify that widget interactions are tracked correctly
  - **Steps**:
    1. Use the test page to track a widget interaction
    2. Verify that the interaction is recorded
  - **Expected Result**: Interaction is tracked successfully

- **Test Case 6.2**: Track Multiple Interactions
  - **Description**: Verify that multiple interactions are tracked correctly
  - **Steps**:
    1. Use the test page to track multiple widget interactions
    2. Verify that all interactions are recorded
  - **Expected Result**: All interactions are tracked successfully

### 4. Lead Data Submission

- **Test Case 7.1**: Submit Lead Data
  - **Description**: Verify that lead data can be submitted
  - **Steps**:
    1. Use the test page to submit lead data
    2. Verify that the lead data is recorded
  - **Expected Result**: Lead data is submitted successfully

- **Test Case 7.2**: Submit Invalid Lead Data
  - **Description**: Verify that invalid lead data is handled gracefully
  - **Steps**:
    1. Use the test page to submit invalid lead data
  - **Expected Result**: Appropriate error message is returned

### 5. Error Handling and Logging

- **Test Case 8.1**: Server Errors
  - **Description**: Verify that server errors are handled gracefully
  - **Steps**:
    1. Simulate a server error
    2. Verify that the error is handled gracefully
  - **Expected Result**: Appropriate error message is displayed to the user

- **Test Case 8.2**: Network Errors
  - **Description**: Verify that network errors are handled gracefully
  - **Steps**:
    1. Simulate a network error
    2. Verify that the error is handled gracefully
  - **Expected Result**: Appropriate error message is displayed to the user

- **Test Case 8.3**: Logging
  - **Description**: Verify that errors are logged correctly
  - **Steps**:
    1. Trigger various errors
    2. Check the logs
  - **Expected Result**: Errors are logged with appropriate details

## Test Execution

To execute these tests, we will use the following tools:

1. **test-widget-config.html**: HTML page for testing the widget configuration system
2. **run-test-widget-config.sh**: Script to run the test HTML page

### Running the Tests

1. Deploy the widget configuration functions:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-widget-config-functions.sh
   ```

2. Run the test page:
   ```bash
   ./run-test-widget-config.sh
   ```

3. Follow the test cases outlined above to verify the functionality.

## Test Results

Document the results of each test case, including:

- Pass/Fail status
- Any issues encountered
- Screenshots or logs as evidence
- Recommendations for improvements

## Next Steps

After completing the verification, we will:

1. Address any issues found during testing
2. Document the lessons learned
3. Proceed to Week 3 implementation
