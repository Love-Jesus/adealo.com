# Backup of Documentation Files

These documentation files were consolidated into the new documentation files:

- WIDGET-SYSTEM.md
- TEAM-SYSTEM.md
- STRIPE-INTEGRATION.md
- DEPLOYMENT.md
- PROJECT-MAP.md
- WIDGET-CLEANUP.md
- README.md

They are kept here for reference in case they contain information that was not captured in the new documentation.

## Restoration

If you need to restore these files, you can copy them back to the project root directory.
