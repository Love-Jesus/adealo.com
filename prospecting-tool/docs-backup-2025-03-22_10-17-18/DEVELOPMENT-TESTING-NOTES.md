# Development Testing Notes

## Test Results (March 19, 2025)

We performed a series of pre-deployment tests on the prospecting tool to identify any potential issues. Here's a summary of our findings:

### 1. Production Build Test

```bash
npm run build
```

**Results:**
- Build completed successfully
- TypeScript errors found: 162 errors
- All errors were related to unused imports and variables (code quality issues, not functional issues)

### 2. Linting Test

```bash
npm run lint
```

**Results:**
- 453 linting issues found (441 errors, 12 warnings)
- Most common issues:
  - Unused variables and imports
  - Use of `any` type instead of more specific types
  - Missing React Hook dependencies
  - Fast refresh compatibility warnings

### 3. Dependency Check

```bash
npm outdated
```

**Results:**
- Minor version updates available for several packages:
  - @stripe/react-stripe-js
  - @types/react
  - lucide-react
  - next
- Major version update available for:
  - globals (dev dependency)

### 4. Firebase Emulators Test

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

**Results:**
- Emulators started successfully
- Firebase Functions loaded correctly
- Warning about outdated firebase-functions SDK version

### 5. Browser Console Check

**Results:**
- App functions correctly with Firebase emulators
- Authentication working properly
- Firestore queries executing successfully
- Widget data loading correctly
- Widget creation working

**Console Issues:**
- Crypto module warning (Vite-specific issue)
- Stripe integration warnings (expected in development)
- Accessibility issues with DialogContent components
- Form fields missing id/name attributes
- Cookie-related warnings

## Development Workflow Recommendations

### Regular Testing Cycle

1. **Weekly Build Tests**
   - Run `npm run build` weekly to catch TypeScript errors early
   - Address critical errors immediately, track non-critical ones

2. **Periodic Linting**
   - Run `npm run lint` after completing major features
   - Focus on fixing errors that could cause runtime issues

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Check dependencies monthly with `npm outdated`
   - Plan updates strategically, prioritizing security updates

4. **Firebase Emulator Testing**
   - Test with emulators before implementing new Firebase-dependent features
   - Verify functions, authentication, and database operations

### Technical Debt Management

Keep track of the following issues to address before final deployment:

1. **Code Quality Issues**
   - Remove unused imports and variables
   - Replace `any` types with specific types
   - Fix React Hook dependency warnings

2. **Accessibility Issues**
   - Add DialogTitle to DialogContent components
   - Add aria attributes to DialogContent
   - Add id or name attributes to form fields

3. **Firebase Updates**
   - Update firebase-functions SDK to latest version
   - Test thoroughly after update due to breaking changes

4. **Stripe Integration**
   - Ensure Stripe.js integration uses HTTPS in production
   - Test payment flows in Stripe test mode

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before final deployment, complete this checklist:

- [ ] Run production build and fix all errors
- [ ] Run linter and address all errors
- [ ] Update dependencies to latest stable versions
- [ ] Test with Firebase emulators
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify all Firebase functions work correctly
- [ ] Test Stripe integration with test credentials
- [ ] Run a deployment dry run: `firebase deploy --only hosting --dry-run`
- [ ] Address all accessibility issues
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS is used for all external connections

## Conclusion

The application is functioning well overall, with the Firebase emulators successfully running and core functionality working correctly. The issues found are primarily code quality and accessibility concerns that don't affect the core functionality but should be addressed before final deployment.

The solid foundation is in place, making it a good time to continue development while periodically running these tests to ensure the codebase remains healthy.
